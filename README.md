# The Oddmentarium
... or odds and ends, bits and bobs, whatever takes your fancy.

This is filled with small programmes that don't fit into any larger project. They just document my coding journey along various online courses, offline courses, challenge websites, or whatever tickled my fancy at the time. Of course the really old programmes are not in here. The ones I wrote before keeping them for posterity was a thing. Which means I'll have to get back into C++ and Java just to reconstruct the early years. I'll have to start all over again ... good.

I hope to feed this repo regularly. Feel free to browse.
