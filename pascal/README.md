# Pascal
Pascal? No, really, Pascal?? <br/>Not that Pascal guy who collects grammars? Sure? <br/>Well, if you must, here is some Pascal code written during the course "Einführung in die imperative Programmierung" at Fern-Universität in Hagen.

P.S.: If you do have grammars of odd and/or little known/spoken human languages or unusual and old printed grammars, drop me a line. I really do know a Pascal who collects those, he has over 3000 volumes and is delighted at every new one he can get.
